# Chirper Scala JS Diode

Same as ChirperScalaJS but using Diode (the redux for Scala.js)


## Current state
Project started nothing implemented.

## Usage
Compare to Chirper, this version takes more memory and I had to increase the memory with this command before running sbt:
```
> export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g -Xss4m"
```

Go to the project directory and issue those commands:
```
> sbt
> runAll
```

open you browser with this url: http://localhost:9000
